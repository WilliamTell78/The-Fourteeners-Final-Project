\section{ABSTRACT}
Will
Will-Also put and format images into project.
This year the students of AerE 361 were tasked with solving a problem using a circuit playground express(CPX) board.
For many of us, this was the first time working and testing hardware while simultaneously working on its code. We originally
were meant to be exposed to this during freshman year with the butter tray robots, but unfortunately COVID put a lid on that.
Our group `The Fourteeners' wanted to have some fun with the project so we took a real life concern for a modern day soccer player
and shrunk it down to LEGO size. Below we will walk through what exactly we solved using the CPX and how we went about doing so.
There will also be a reflection section where we talk about the status, lessons learned, our results, and things moving forward.
\section{INTRODUCTION}
Khushi
The introduction is where you will introduce your group and your project. List out the team members (optionally include a picture) and what their role is. Briefly introduce your project, what it does and why. A minimum of 2 paragraphs. Introduction is worth 5 points.

\section{FEATURES}
Khushi
The features section is where you will outline the final list of features that your device ended up with. This should not be a copy from proposal and I expect that some minor changes may have happened. If you did need to make a change, include what those changes were and why. You can do an itemized list of your features, but you must have a supporting paragraph or two that goes into further detail. This section is worth 5 points.


\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
Will
Like we said above, our group wanted to have some fun with the project. We took the real 
life soccer player Lionel Messi and looked at his penalty kick percentage. According to the statistics reported by
Michel Acosta(reference) we saw that he had missed 22 percent of his shots. Not neccessarily amazing for the superstar, and not to mention
there's always been a question about who's the best player; Ronaldo or Messi? Currently Ronaldo has
the better shooting percentage for penalty kicks sitting at 83 percent. In order to change that our group
needed to provide Messi with a way to not only practice his penalty kicks, but efficiently choose where to place them
in order to score. Additionally, lets say we want to make this universal, for other players. We needed to create a
feedback system to the let the kicker know the liklieness of scoring on a goalie.

The problem we are solving is that Mr. Messi has been struggling with penalty kicks. According to the website `instatsport'\cite{Penalty_stats},
out of all the penalty kicks taken, 25 percent of them didn't result in a goal. Messi's recent kicks place his performance in that 25 percent. Our 
job is to acquire data for the best scoring locations and provide Messi with these targets. He will practice his shooting, aiming at the targets we 
provide in the goal while we display the improvement or likelihood of scoring. This will be achieved using multiple servos and a joystick. The joystick 
will be connected via the USB port and give commands to the servos. The servos will move in a similar way that we use our hands to control a Foosball player. 
The website Maker Pro\cite{maker.pro} has a really good tutorial on how to do this using an Arduino Uno. This is a little bit different because it uses pins 
and wiring. We are gonna try and save slots on the CPX and use the USB port as mentioned earlier. The way we will measure his scoring ability is using the 
ultrasonic sensor on the CPX as well as an attached Square Force-Sensitive Resistor. There's also guides on the Adafruit\cite{Adafruit_Ultrasonic_Sensor} website 
on connecting and setting up the ultrasonic sensor using a breadboard and four wires. The main task at hand for us will be how we set a specific distance away 
from the CPX for the goal line. All of this culminates to add a counter we will show on a small LCD. The counter will display a couple of different cases. The first 
case is that he scored. The second is that he scored and hit a target which we will have placed either in the corners, or dead center. We chose these locations based 
off of a statistical heat map of likely goal locations during penalty shots. We found the article on `thestatszone'\cite{StatsZone.com}. This counter is how we measure 
Messi's progress. 

\section{PROBLEM SOLUTION}
Delane
Here, you go into detail what your solution to the problem is.  I expect that this will have several subsections and you should breakout each area.  You should include any graphics and pictures as relevant as well and reference them like Figure \ref{fig:cpx}.
\begin{figure}[!t]

\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{cpx01.jpg}
\caption{This is the circuit playground express}
\label{fig:cpx}
\end{figure}

Again, cite any sources that you have.  If you took snippets of code or found a paper that discusses on how to do something, then you need to cite it. The same if you got inspiration for code from a source, cite that as well. For this final project report, I am expecting at least 3 sources cited.  One will probably be what you had in your problem statement from your proposal.  

Your problem solution is one of the largest things we look at. I am looking for the following items:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How did you come up with your solution
    \item How did you test or verify your solution
    \item Do you think this was a good solution?
    \item Show as much as you can of the solution in action (pictures and/or data)
\end{itemize}

For this reason, this section has the most points at 25 points

\section{STATUS}
Alex
Here, you need to honestly assess what the status of the project is.  If successful, state that it was successful and all the goals that it achieved (your goals are from your project proposal).  If not successful, state what was completed, what was not completed and state what happened. This part is worth 5 points

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
Khushi
Here, put any lessons learned from this project.  This may also relate to some of the items that you did not accomplish with this project. If you did not accomplish something, why? What might you do differently? I am also looking for what the group learned through this process. The obvious answer is ``programming'', but I am looking beyond that. Tell me what other skills you think that you learned or that you improved up working on the project. These can include ``soft'' skills like teamwork, communication, leadership, etc. This section is worth 10 points

\section{RESULTS}
 Alex
Put all results here.  If you collected data, explain and show at least some analysis on the data you collected.  If no data is collected, you should have collected reactions from others using your device and put that feedback here.  Any graphs you generated should be here as well.

You must include a copy of your source code in the appendix.  There is an example of this below.  Also, include the link to your GitHub repository.  You can use the \verb=\url=  command like this \url{https://github.com/AerE-361-FinalProject/Project-Report-AerE-361}. Make sure you reference where the code is located as well as any other data. This section is worth 10 points.


\section{FUTURE WORK}
Khushi
Your future work includes what your team would continue to improve on and change if you had more time.  This could be expanding additional features or fixing something that you couldn't figure out.  It helps to explain at least a little on what you would plan to do to improve your product. This section is worth 5 points.

\section{CONCLUSION}
Alex
Finally, wrap up your report. Although there is no points here, it is expected.
